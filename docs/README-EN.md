## Database Configuration

### Connection Details

- **Host Name**: ep-tiny-dream-a58ddhin.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech
- **Database Name**: neondb
- **User**: neondb_owner
- **Password**: npg_5HAIWZB9tncz
- **Complete Connection URL**: 
  ```
  postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_5HAIWZB9tncz@ep-tiny-dream-a58ddhin.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
  ```

### Database Access

The database is hosted on the Neon PostgreSQL service, which offers a serverless PostgreSQL in the cloud. To connect:

1. Use the connection URL directly in your applications
2. Or connect using a SQL client such as:
   - psql: `psql "postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_5HAIWZB9tncz@ep-tiny-dream-a58ddhin.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require"`
   - Graphical tools like DBeaver, pgAdmin or TablePlus using the details above

**Note**: This connection requires SSL (sslmode=require).

## Demo Data Management

The system has a mechanism to manage demo data, useful for testing and presentations:

- **Data Generation**: Scripts to populate the system with demo data
- **Data Cleaning**: Functions to remove demo data without affecting real data
- **Clean Mode**: Option to completely disable demo data

To clean all demo data, use the script:
```bash
node reset-all-demo-data.js
```

## AI Service Migration
