# Migration from Mistral to Google Gemini

## Overview

This document details the migration performed from Mistral AI service to Google Gemini, including code changes, tests conducted, and the implemented status check component.

## Migration Rationale

The migration from Mistral to Google Gemini was implemented for the following reasons:

1. **More models available**: Google Gemini offers 17 different models, allowing selection of the most appropriate one for each type of task.
2. **Better computer vision support**: Advanced image processing capabilities for PDF document analysis.
3. **Greater API stability**: More stable and consistent interface for integrations.
4. **Better performance**: Faster and more accurate responses, especially for document data extraction.

## Main Changes

### 1. Service Adapter Structure

An adapter pattern was implemented that allows switching between different AI services without modifying client code:

- `AIAdapter`: Main class that manages which service is active
- `GeminiService`: Specific implementation for the Google Gemini API
- `MistralService`: Previous implementation (maintained for temporary compatibility)

### 2. Status Check Endpoint

A new endpoint was created to check the status of AI services:

```
GET /api/check-ai-services
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "currentService": "gemini",
  "services": {
    "gemini": {
      "status": "active",
      "models": 17,
      "description": "Google AI service"
    },
    "mistral": {
      "status": "deprecated",
      "models": 5,
      "description": "Service replaced by Google Gemini"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. UI Component for Service Status

A React component (`AIServiceStatus`) was developed to display the current status of AI services:

- Located at: `client/src/components/ai-service-status.tsx`
- Integrated in the settings page: `client/src/pages/settings/index.tsx`
- Fully translated in Portuguese and English

## Tests Performed

1. **Connection verification**: Connectivity test with Google Gemini API
2. **Model testing**: Verification of availability of the 17 Gemini models
3. **Performance comparison**: Analysis of response time and accuracy in data extraction
4. **PDF processing**: Testing data extraction from reservation documents
5. **Function calling**: Testing the use of function call capability to structure data

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

To use the Gemini service, the following environment variable needs to be configured:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

The old Mistral key (`MISTRAL_API_KEY`) is still maintained for compatibility but is no longer the primary service.

### Service Configuration

The current service can be changed through the configuration object in `server/config.ts`:

```typescript
export const aiConfig = {
  defaultService: 'gemini', // Options: 'gemini', 'mistral'
  // ...other configurations
};
```

## Future Work

1. **Complete removal of Mistral**: Plan to completely remove support for Mistral in a future version
2. **Expansion of vision capabilities**: Improve document processing with advanced Gemini vision features
3. **Streaming implementation**: Implement streaming responses for more fluid interactions in the assistant

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

- **Error 401**: Invalid or expired API key. Check the `GEMINI_API_KEY` configuration.
- **Error 403**: API limitations have been reached. Check the limits of your Google AI account.
- **Error 404**: Requested model not found. Check if you are requesting a valid model.

### Status Verification

To check the current status of AI services:

1. Access the settings page â†’ "Integrations" tab
2. Check the "AI Services Status" component
3. Alternatively, make a GET request to `/api/check-ai-services`
