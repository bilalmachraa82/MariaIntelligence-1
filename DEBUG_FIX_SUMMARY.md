# 🐛 Debug Fix Summary - AI Assistant

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Translation Keys ✅
**Problem**: Multiple "aiAssistant.*" translation keys were showing as missing in the console.
**Root Cause**: The keys existed in the translation files but were being accessed before i18n was fully initialized.
**Status**: Keys are present in `/client/src/i18n/locales/pt-PT.json` and properly structured.

### 2. API Endpoint Missing ✅
**Problem**: `/api/check-gemini-key` was returning HTML (404) instead of JSON.
**Solution**: Created the missing API endpoint at `/api/check-gemini-key.js`
**Features**:
- Checks for Gemini API key in environment variables
- Returns proper JSON response
- Validates API key with Google Generative AI
- CORS headers configured

### 3. Build Configuration Issues ✅
**Problems**:
- Vite was looking for index.html in wrong location
- @shared imports were not resolved
- Output directory mismatch with Vercel

**Solutions**:
- Updated `vite.config.ts` with proper root and alias paths
- Added @shared alias to both vite and TypeScript configs
- Fixed output directory to "dist" in vercel.json
