## 🚨 Issues Found & Resolutions

### Critical Issues (Deployment Blocking)
**Count:** 0 ❌ **No critical issues found**

### High Priority Issues
**Count:** 1
1. **Client Build Missing**
   - **Issue:** Server expects built client assets in `/dist/public`
   - **Impact:** Frontend not accessible
   - **Fix:** Run `npm run build` in client directory before deployment
   - **Priority:** High (required for full-stack deployment)

### Medium Priority Issues  
**Count:** 2
1. **Database Configuration**
   - **Issue:** DATABASE_URL not configured
   - **Impact:** Using mock data instead of persistent storage
   - **Fix:** Configure Neon PostgreSQL DATABASE_URL environment variable
   - **Priority:** Medium (MVP can function without persistent storage)

2. **AI Services Configuration**
   - **Issue:** AI services not fully configured
   - **Impact:** Document processing features limited
   - **Fix:** Configure GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable
   - **Priority:** Medium (not required for core MVP functionality)
